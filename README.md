I am Fulton Browne, A devoloper out to change the world through open source software.

I have an open source voice assistant for android called ara, it has an android [app](https://github.com/FultonBrowne/Ara-android), a [server](https://github.com/FultonBrowne/Ara-Server) written in java and kotlin, and an NLP (natural language processing) [backend](https://github.com/FultonBrowne/ara-nlp) written in python.

I also enjoy working with linux and UNIX systems, I have a mksh based shell called [fksh](https://github.com/FultonBrowne/fksh), a power managment utility called [fpm](https://github.com/FultonBrowne/fpm) and I am looking into building other projects and contributing to the linux kernel in the future.

At this time I am learning about blockchain, cryptography, and lower level programming languages.

I really enjoy coffee, you can buy me one [here](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/28EcqNL) you can also give my any erc20 tokens [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe7d960ee16d6fcddeb66b0afbbfa051f61ef0e6c).
