## 👋 Hey, I'm Fulton Browne
A CS freshman at Samford university in Birmingham, AL and a senior software engineer at [Neonaut](https://neonaut.io/). I've been coding for a little while and you can find about 60% of what I've written, projects I've half done, and random things I forked here.
### 👨‍💻 What kind of technologies have you worked with?
- 🕸️ On the web side of things I'm well versed in backend full stack with a wide variety of frameworks in Java, Rust, Go, and Python
- 🔥 I've been working with transformer based language models since 2019 and almost everything I do in my free time these days works with them in some way
- 💻 I love working on things close to the hardware, memory maps are fun for me and I love to get my hands dirt with C, rust, and I'm really eyeing Zig right now
- 🐧 I'm a big fan of Linux and anything UNIX based. I've done the BSD rabbit hole used Arch for a minute (BTW) and even did dabbled with Plan9 (and it's the ultimate form of Operating System can't lie)
- 👽 Love Lisp and all things functional and weird, I'm always down to try a language that changes the way I think about code
### 🍻 What (else) do you do for fun
- 🥾 I love hiking all over the place and am currently trying to hit every national park and forest
- 📸 While I'm a hiking I love taking photos and I have a little too many film camera
- 🚙 I'm also a big fan of cars (mostly jeeps) and I have a lot of fun with my rig
