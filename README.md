I'm Fulton Browne, A 16 year old (class o' 2023) programmer.

I've moved most of my stuff (git, web, email, blog) to my server at [fulton.software](http://fulton.software). This GitHub works mostly as a 300 to that server's content.

I am curently learning about cryptography and lower level programming.

I used to run an open source voice assistant for android called Ara, it had an android [app](https://github.com/FultonBrowne/Ara-android), a [server](https://github.com/FultonBrowne/Ara-Server) written in java and kotlin, and an NLP (natural language processing) [backend](https://github.com/FultonBrowne/ara-nlp) written in python. As of now ara is not under active devolpment.

I really enjoy coffee, you can buy me one [here](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/28EcqNL) you can also give my any erc20 tokens [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe7d960ee16d6fcddeb66b0afbbfa051f61ef0e6c).
