## 👋 Hey, I'm Fulton Browne
I am a CS sophomore at Samford University in Birmingham, AL, and SWE [Banker Bounty](https://www.bankerbounty.com/). I've been coding for a while, and you can find about 60% of what I've written, projects I've half done, and random things I forked here.
### 👨‍💻 What kind of technologies have you worked with?
- 🕸️ On the web side of things I'm well versed in backend full stack with a wide variety of frameworks in PHP, Java, Rust, Go, and Python
- 🔥 I've been working with transformer-based language models since 2019 and almost everything I do in my free time these days works with them in some way
- 💻 I love working on things close to the hardware, memory maps are fun for me and I love to get my hands dirty with C, rust, and Zig.
- 🐧 I'm a big fan of Linux and anything UNIX-based. I've done the BSD rabbit hole used Arch for a minute (BTW) and even dabbled with Plan9. I'm a big fan of any project rethinking the OS
- 👽 Love Lisp and all things functional and weird, I'm always down to try a language that changes the way I think about code
### 🍻 What (else) do you do for fun
- 🥾 I love hiking all over the place and am currently trying to hit every national park and forest
- 📸 While I'm hiking I love taking photos and I have a little too many film camera
- 🚙 I'm also a big fan of cars (mostly Jeeps) and I have a lot of fun with my rig
